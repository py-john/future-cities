                    <div class="profile__section--content">
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Planning and developing entertainment-based ancillary real estate that utilizes and integrates existing or planned destination attractors as anchor developments.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Today’s arenas, stadia and theatres and other one-of-type venues establish a strong drawing power which is supported through continual media exposure promoting the events staged there. Additional value - beyond that found in traditional urban development - is created when this advantage is developed on a district-wide basis.</p>

                        <h5 class="heading-quinary u-margin-bottom-small">Entertainment District Development</h5>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">District Development is the creation of planned urban environments that support and benefit from destination attractions such as sports arenas / stadiums and music venues, and expands that opportunity to include urban residential and boutique work places. </p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Advantages to a total planned District include expanded tourism, increased spending on retail, food and beverage, greater after-hour use of existing parking and transit, increases in sales tax revenue and more opportunities for original programming and revenues, managed district sponsorship and advertising.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Desirable results in the District Development approach include:

                                <li class="paragraph__list--item">Initiating and sustaining a known development environment through the creation of a special entertainment district overlay</li>

                    <h4 class="heading-quaternary u-margin-bottom-small" id="venue-development">Sports and Entertainment Venue Creation</h4>
                    <div class="profile__section--content">
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Creating process models that lead owners and cities to the successful development of next-generation sports, theatres, clubs and other public assembly venues.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">The basis for Future Cities’ development approach is to treat these projects both as internally connected revenue programs, and as components of an active street presence - connected and necessary parts of modern urban life. This is accomplished through working with sports team owners and cities to explore the undiscovered opportunities both inside and outside venues. These include ‘experiential sponsorship’, creative integrated seating, club and lounge concepts targeted to specific core demographics, and retail product development and sales and equally important - ancillary real estate development opportunities.</p>

                        <h5 class="heading-quinary u-margin-bottom-small">Venue Development</h5>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Future Cities provides owner advocacy and development leadership for complex sports, live theatre and other live event developments. Our participation is designed to create maximum value while delivering on traditional expectations of public sector interests: the creation of a tourist draw as well a demonstrable economic stimulator for the creation of a viable ancillary development. These elements create an attractive package of benefits for most cities that helps ensure public-side cooperation and participation.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Owners of professional franchises, sports authorities and government bodies intent on the successful development of venues must be prepared to anticipate the next trends in facility design and revenue development. That preparation must involve facts, unambiguous program intent, and creating a compatible team of experts in all areas with the communication tools to connect all of these disparate pieces together.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Most sports and entertainment development programs fall short of maximizing their potential revenues because marketing and sales staff for most sports franchises are tasked with the selling of premium products, and not in their invention and creation. Those ideas that eventually make their way into the design of a stadium or arena usually arrive there because it was done somewhere else first and shared through “best practices” seminars.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">The most successful arenas and stadiums in the future will use revenue planning as a basis for design. These core concepts will be developed not as leftover opportunities, but through rigorous analysis, design and development, marketing and selling.</p>

                        <h5 class="heading-quinary u-margin-bottom-small">Future Theater</h5>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Future Theatre promotes the development of live theater and music venues in strategic locations in both the U.S. and abroad. These projects are public/private ventures that are designed to capture an underserved entertainment market and provide a catalytic development opportunity for urban centers.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Research has indicated a need for a new type of performance venue seating between 5000 and 7000 persons. Performance facilities that currently exist in major metropolitan areas generally fall into one of two categories: less than 2500 seats, which serves the touring Broadway, local symphony and performance arts market, and over 18,000 which serves the sports and mega-concert tour industry.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">This new facility type, represented by the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix and Nokia Theatre at LA Live in Los Angeles allows for an array of headliner shows that are not well suited for either the smaller local theaters or large-scale sports venues.</p>
